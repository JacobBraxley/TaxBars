This is our organization document.  

Our goal is to create a page that allows you to get a sense of how your money is spent and how changing spending affects you.

The site will load Federal and/or State and/or Local data which shows spending.
The site will load a typical person's wages and associated taxes. 
--- (Optional) It will allow the user to enter a custom income in case they would like see what their specific values look like.
--- (Optional) It will allow the user to set specific tax rates (Property, income, etc) rather than use the auto calculated formula.
The site will allow people to increase and decrease funding in areas of their interest.
--- (Optional) Increases and Decreases in an Area will have a information section which indicates the likely change in services associated with the change.  
--- --- (Optional) The source of said expected outcome will be transparent and switchable.
The site will allow people to lock any Bar to keep it unaffected by other changes.
--- In practice they could lock overall spending so reduction in 1 area increases in others
